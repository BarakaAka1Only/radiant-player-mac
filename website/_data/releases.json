[{"name":"v1.5.0","version":"1.5.0","date":"2015-10-31T22:16:36Z","notes":"This release is largely to fix issues affecting the usability of Radiant Player. However, the largest piece of news is that development of Radiant Player has been moved into an organization on GitHub, and a few collaborators have been brought on board in order to help develop Radiant Player and fix outstanding issues. Thank you to everyone who pushed for this! I'm sorry for the incredible delay between versions and addressing major issues, but hopefully this will be less of concern going forward with the new organization.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n\r\n- Use the Sparkle update framework for more intuitive and user-friendly update process\r\n- Fix broken styling in Black theme (thanks <a href='https://github.com/shawn-mitch' class='user-mention'>@shawn-mitch</a>)\r\n- Fix broken media keys by catching up to Google update\r\n- Fix broken Last.fm scrobbling in OS X 10.11 El Capitan (thanks <a href='https://github.com/chrismou' class='user-mention'>@chrismou</a>)\r\n\r\n<!-- SPARKLESIG MC4CFQCa2vrEpUVtAXjK2wWUwP460GjuVgIVALTsPhYGM7mMn0HC2e7bGXYKq2jCtest -->","sparkle":{"signature":"MC4CFQCa2vrEpUVtAXjK2wWUwP460GjuVgIVALTsPhYGM7mMn0HC2e7bGXYKq2jCtest","minimum_version":"10.9"},"asset":{"url":"https://github.com/radiant-player/radiant-player-mac/releases/download/v1.5.0/Radiant.Player.zip","size":2673676}},{"name":"v1.4.1","version":"1.4.1","date":"2015-10-06T21:14:23Z","notes":"This is a small release that fixes the main bugs that made Radiant Player entirely unusable for a little while now. \r\n\r\n- Fixed styling errors (fixes #340)\r\n- Used new copy of Web Components fallback (fixes #352, thank you <a href='https://github.com/jacobwgillespie' class='user-mention'>@jacobwgillespie</a>)\r\n- Radiant Player launches properly on OS X El Capitan\r\n\r\nMy apologies to everyone for being so unavailable, and thank you to those that provided unofficial binaries and code changes.","sparkle":{"signature":null,"minimum_version":"10.9"},"asset":{"url":"https://github.com/radiant-player/radiant-player-mac/releases/download/v1.4.1/Radiant.Player.app.zip","size":1581971}},{"name":"v1.4.0","version":"1.4.0","date":"2015-06-05T05:40:18Z","notes":"At long last, the actual next version! \r\n\r\n## Changes since the last release\r\n\r\nMajor changes:\r\n- Support Google Play Music's latest redesign\r\n- Mac OS X 10.8 is no longer supported (see #291 for progress, if any, on the possibility of re-instating support)\r\n- Removed all styles except for Google and Black (formerly Spotify Black) due to incompatibility with the new redesign; I will be looking into porting one or two of the original styles to the new design\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n- Prevent brief 'ghost' mini player while switching spaces (fixes #309)\r\n- Allow mini player to be used in other full screen applications (fixes #79)\r\n- Allow reload button to be clicked when internet connectivity is lost while first loading Google Play Music (fixes #313)\r\n- Implement `⌘A` (select all) shortcut (fixes #317)\r\n- Open release page instead of home page when a new version is available\r\n- Prevent dragging of file onto main window (fixes #307, thanks <a href='https://github.com/nielstholenaar' class='user-mention'>@nielstholenaar</a>)\r\n- Add support for `⌘[` and `⌘]` keyboard shortcuts to go forward and backward (fixes #296, thanks <a href='https://github.com/gholts' class='user-mention'>@gholts</a>)\r\n\r\nMany thanks to all the testers of the two beta releases, and I will certainly be continuing to look into the outstanding issues that a couple users have reported.

However, for my machine, Google Play Music does not load in Radiant Player, while it does work properly in Safari. It appears that, at least for me, the version of WebKit used by applications and the version used by Safari differ on the same machine. In order to allow the majority of users to appreciate the working version of Radiant Player, __I will be releasing the next `stable` version while dropping official support for Mac OS X 10.8__. If you are on Mountain Lion and this beta does work properly, please do contact me! I will also try to investigate in the future whether it will be possible to re-extend support to include Mac OS X 10.8.\r\n\r\nMy apologies everyone for getting this out so late!
